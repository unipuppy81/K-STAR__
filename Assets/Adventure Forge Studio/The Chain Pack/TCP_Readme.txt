Thank you for purchasing Adventure Forge's Chain Pack

Summary of package:

This package contains a number of chains in different configurations that use cutout textures to create the illusion of chains. 
Each link is just a double sided quad, 4 triangles in total.
This make the chains very lite weight triangle wise, with most prefabs comming in under 1000 triangles.
